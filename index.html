            <h3>The History of Ottoman Empire</h3>
            <p>The Ottoman Empire was one of the mightiest and longest-lasting dynasties in world history. This
                Islamic-run
                superpower ruled large areas of the Middle East, Eastern Europe and North Africa for more than 600
                years.
                The chief leader, known as the Sultan, was given absolute religious and political authority over his
                people.
                While Western Europeans generally viewed them as a threat, many historians regard the Ottoman Empire as
                a
                source of great regional stability and security, as well as important achievements in the arts, science,
                religion and culture. <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/ottoman-empire">[Copied from
