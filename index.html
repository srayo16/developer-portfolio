            <h3>The History of Ottoman Empire</h3>
            <p>The Ottoman Empire was one of the mightiest and longest-lasting dynasties in world history. This
                Islamic-run
                superpower ruled large areas of the Middle East, Eastern Europe and North Africa for more than 600
                years.
                The chief leader, known as the Sultan, was given absolute religious and political authority over his
                people.
                While Western Europeans generally viewed them as a threat, many historians regard the Ottoman Empire as
                a
                source of great regional stability and security, as well as important achievements in the arts, science,
                religion and culture. <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/ottoman-empire">[Copied from

                Tughra Suleiman the Magnificent's signature
                Suleiman I (Ottoman Turkish: سليمان اول, romanized: Süleyman-ı Evvel; Turkish: I. Süleyman; 6 November
                1494 – 6 September 1566), commonly known as Suleiman the Magnificent in the West and Suleiman the
                Lawgiver (Ottoman Turkish: قانونى سلطان سليمان, romanized: Ḳānūnī Sulṭān Süleymān) in his realm, was the
                tenth and longest-reigning Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1520 until his death in 1566. 541–45  Under
                his administration, the Ottoman caliphate ruled over at least 25 million people.

                Suleiman succeeded his father, Selim I, as sultan in September 1520 and began his reign with campaigns
                against the Christian powers in central Europe and the Mediterranean. Belgrade fell to him in 1521 and
                the island of Rhodes in 1522–23. At Mohács, in August 1526, Suleiman broke the military strength of
                Hungary.

                Suleiman became a prominent monarch of 16th-century Europe, presiding over the apex of the Ottoman
                Empire's economic, military and political power. Suleiman personally led Ottoman armies in conquering
                the Christian strongholds of Belgrade and Rhodes as well as most of Hungary before his conquests were
                checked at the siege of Vienna in 1529. He annexed much of the Middle East in his conflict with the
                Safavids and large areas of North Africa as far west as Algeria. Under his rule, the Ottoman fleet
                dominated the seas from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and through the Persian Gulf.

                At the helm of an expanding empire, Suleiman personally instituted major judicial changes relating to
                society, education, taxation and criminal law. His reforms, carried out in conjunction with the empire's
                chief judicial official Ebussuud Efendi, harmonized the relationship between the two forms of Ottoman
                law: sultanic (Kanun) and religious (Sharia). He was a distinguished poet and goldsmith; he also became
                a great patron of culture, overseeing the "Golden" age of the Ottoman Empire in its artistic, literary
                and architectural development.

                Breaking with Ottoman tradition, Suleiman married Hürrem Sultan, a woman from his harem, an Orthodox
                Christian of Ruthenian origin who converted to Islam, and who became famous in the West by the name
                Roxelana, due to her red hair. Their son, Selim II, succeeded Suleiman following his death in 1566 after
                46 years of rule. Suleiman's other potential heirs, Mehmed and Mustafa, had died; Mehmed had died in
                1543 from smallpox, and Mustafa had been strangled to death in 1553 at the sultan's order. His other son
                Bayezid was executed in 1561 on Suleiman's orders, along with Bayezid's four sons, after a rebellion.
                Although scholars prefer "crisis and adaptation" rather than decline after his death, the end of
                Suleiman's reign was a watershed in Ottoman history. In the decades after Suleiman, the empire began to
                experience significant political, institutional, and economic changes, a phenomenon often referred to as
                the Transformation of the Ottoman Empire.

                <p>
                    Şehzade Mustafa (Ottoman Turkish: شهزاده مصطفى‎; 6 August 1515 – 6 October 1553) was an Ottoman
                    prince
                    and the son of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and his consort Mahidevran Sultan. He was the
                    prince-governor of Manisa from 1532 to 1542, of Amasya from 1542 to 1549, and of Konya from 1549 to
                    1553. Şehzade Mustafa was the heir apparent to the Ottoman throne and an immensely popular prince
                    among
                    the army and the populace prior to his execution, by the order of his father Suleiman.

                <p>
                    Şehzade Bayezid (Ottoman Turkish: شهزاده بايزيد‎; 1525 – 25 September 1561) was an Ottoman prince as
                    the
                    son of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and Hurrem Sultan. After the execution of Şehzade Mustafa
                    (who
                    had been the heir apparent to the Ottoman throne) in 1553, Bayezid became the popular heir among the
                    army. Throughout the 1550s, when Suleiman was already in his 60s, a protracted competition for the
                    throne between Bayezid and his brother Selim became evident. Bayezid had fallen into disfavor with
                    his
                    father – who was angered by Bayezid's disobedience stemming from around the same years – as opposed
                    to
                    Selim (who would eventually succeed as Selim II). After being defeated in a battle near Konya in
                    1559 by
                    Selim and Sokullu Mehmet Pasha (with the help of the Sultan's army), he fled to the neighbouring
                    Safavid
                    Empire, where he was lavishly received by Tahmasp I. However, in 1561, on the continuous insistence
                    of
                    the Sultan throughout his son's exile, and after several large payments, Tahmasp allowed Bayezid to
                    be
                    executed by agents of his own father.
